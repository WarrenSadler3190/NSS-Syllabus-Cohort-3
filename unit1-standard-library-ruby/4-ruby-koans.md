The assignment for this evening (Wednesday) is to finish the Cheers exercise and then get started on the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).

Follow the instructions on the Ruby Koans website and try to make it through the Strings exercises.  We'll begin walking through your questions about the Koans on Thursday.
