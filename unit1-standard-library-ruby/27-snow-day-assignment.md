Read about `git add -p`: http://johnkary.net/blog/git-add-p-the-most-powerful-git-feature-youre-not-using-yet/

Check out this article on working with classes in Ruby.  It reiterates what we covered in class yesterday: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/ruby-for-newbies-working-with-classes/

For that matter, you might want to check out other articles in that series: http://net.tutsplus.com/sessions/ruby-for-newbies/

If you want to read ahead, you can optionally take a look at these articles on linked list.  We'll be covering this in class, so it's not necessary to look at it now : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list.  Wikipedia goes into excruciating details and variations, so here's an article with pictures!: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/linked%20lists.html

I've also attached a Ruby cheat sheet that the last class found helpful (see item 28).
